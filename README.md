This project is aimed at practicing and solidifying the skills learned in the past three sprints at Yandex Practicum. The layout is done using HTML and CSS languages. Flexbox, grid, and element positioning techniques were used. Animation techniques were applied as well. The project is designed for four screen resolutions and is both fluid and responsive across all resolutions. The block and element naming follows the BEM methodology, and the files are structured using the BEM Nested methodology.
